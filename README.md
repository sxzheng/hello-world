Project HelloWorld

Hey bros!
It's shuangxi here,I like computer programming,Java for now.
In the future I'll learn more language,such as Node.js,Solidity,Cpp.
I don't know how many times I've used github,I really like it but I never learn it serially before.
From now on,I'll learn how to use github and commit my codes as much as I can.
come on,man! I'm ready for future!
